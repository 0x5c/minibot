A collection of tools to aid in creating and using discord.py bots, painlessly.


## Tools

*Click on the tool names to skip to documentation:*

- [Makefile](./docs/makefile.md) ­ ­ Setup script for venv and more

- [run.sh](./docs/run.sh.md) ­ ­ Simple startup script that handles restarting/exiting the bot

- [Skeleton files](./docs/skeleton.md) ­ ­ Minimal templates of important and often missed bot files

- [Docker files](./docs/docker.md) ­ ­ Docker-related files


> **Windows:** Usage of most of these on Windows is untested, but should not cause problems with mingw64, MSYS/2, and such.  
> Well... *probably.*
